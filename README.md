# Made from: Brunch_Sass_Jade_Boilerplate

Get it [here.](https://github.com/AndrewAlva/Brunch_Sass_Jade_Boilerplate) 

Include some libraries I use a lot for different projects like jQuery, Bootstrap Grid and TweenMax (GSAP).


## Getting to know Brunch

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
    * [Brunch site](http://brunch.io), [Getting started guide](https://github.com/brunch/brunch-guide#readme)
